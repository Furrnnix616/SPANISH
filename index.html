               it is an economy with special strength in the service sector. In 2018, this sector represented 66% of GDP and 62% of the labor force, followed by the industrial sector with 31% of GDP and 23.8% of the labor force, and the primary sector with 2.8% of GDP and 13.6% of the workforce. [1] The Mexican economy has been growing at an average rate of 2.2% during the last 10 years despite the complex recent global environment. It is expected that the Mexican economy will continue to grow in 2019 and 2020. The economic development strategy of the Government of Mexico will strengthen this growth, which includes the strengthening of consumption due to the effect of social programs and greater financial inclusion, the promotion of private investment in infrastructure and strategic sectors, greater public investment and the increase in exports as a result of the reconfiguration of global value chains .

				RAW MATERIALS
				<p>One of Vietnam's flagship products is coffee, of which it is the second largest producer and exporter in the world (with 15% of the world total), after Brazil. It is their second largest agricultural product that exports after rice. It is believed that in a few more years it could even displace Brazil as the world's largest exporter, although its large production has caused an oversupply of coffee beans at the moment and this has depressed the price of the product.

                    Second, another of the factors that stands out is the high level of
                    imports of fish and seafood that Vietnam has been doing.
                    According to data collected from Trade Map, Vietnam was placed in 2011 as a quarter
                    importer of fish and seafood between the countries of the southeast region
                    Asian (ASEAN). Its tendency in purchases abroad has been growing,
                    until standing in 2014, along with Malaysia at a similar level, just behind
                    Thailand, however, has seen its number of purchases abroad reduced.
                    Detail of all these data, are collected later in the present specialized study.
                     Vietnam is a country mainly exporter of fish and seafood,
                    which can be clearly seen in the figures and volumes of
                    foreign trade of the country (mainly of pangasius, tuna, shrimp and
                    squid)
                    that one of the most outstanding characteristics of fish consumption in

				ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT
				<P>Vietnam managed to get ahead and overcome many of the consequences of the war, although it should be noted that the traces left in its population by so many years of conflict still continue. Today, Vietnam is unified and has internal stability. It is the thirteenth most populous country in the world, with a large fluid majority in Vietnamese, the official language of the territory. It also has a small percentage of the French-speaking population and a growing number of people who are fluent in the English language [1].

                The education system in Vietnam starts when children are between 5 and 7 years old. As in many other countries, kindergarten is not mandatory although it is an option that many parents choose. Then, they follow the stages of primary (5 years of duration), middle school (4 years) and high school (3 years). On average, Vietnamese finish school between the ages of 17 and 19. The university in Vietnam lasts between 4 and 6 years, depending on the chosen career. Some of the outstanding universities in the country are: Hanoi University of Science and Technology, National University of Ho Chi Minh City.
